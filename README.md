# Day 1
 When I visited **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** first time to attend **Induction Program**, I felt so delighted and lucky one. Firstly, I visit **Gurudwara Sahib** of the College and spent 3hours
 there and it was really a peaceful time of the day. There I learnt many moral values and way to live life in College which was taught by **Granthi** of the Gurudwara.
