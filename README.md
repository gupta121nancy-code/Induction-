# Day 1:_Induction Programme_
   When I visited **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** first time to attend **Induction Program**, I felt so delighted and lucky one. Firstly, I visit **Gurudwara Sahib** of the College and spent **3hours**
 there and it was really a peaceful time of the day. There I learnt many moral values and way to live life in College which was taught by **Granthi** of the Gurudwara. Then I have some refreshments which was arranged by the College Authority. I enjoy the refreshment very much.

    Then all students who came were assembled in auditorium. It was a calm place. There we recognised many honourable
personalities like **Harpreet Kaur Grewal** (HOD Of Applied Science),Dr.Sehajpal Singh (Principal),Dr.K.S Mann (HOD Of IT) and many one. I really inspired by such personalities as well as from our well performing seniors. I really enjoyed that unforgettable and memorable day.
