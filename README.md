# Day 1:_Induction Programme_
   When I visited **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** first time to attend **Induction Program**, I felt so delighted and lucky one. Firstly, I visit **Gurudwara Sahib** of the College and spent **3hours**
 there and it was really a peaceful time of the day. There I learnt many moral values and way to live life in College which was taught by **Granthi** of the Gurudwara. Then I have some refreshments which was arranged by the College Authority. I enjoy the refreshment very much.

    Then all students who came were assembled in auditorium. It was a calm place. There we recognised many honourable
personalities like Harpreet Kaur Grewal (HOD Of Applied Science),Dr.Sehajpal Singh (Principal),Dr.K.S Mann (HOD Of IT) and many one. I really inspired by such personalities as well as from our well performing seniors. I really enjoyed that unforgettable and memorable day.

# Day 2
  In Morning, there is a Proficiency Test for us which is monitored by our seniors. After that we had a break and then all students of CSE and IT again assembled in Auditorium. There we had an interactive session with a Reputed and Honourable Personality named _Dr.Jaswinder Singh_. He proves that science and mathematics is very interesting and simple to handle. He familiarised with many new Mathematical tricks and then _Dr. Arshdeep Sir_ gave a really noteable and important about food. Then our seniors gave a session about Causmic Club. It's really a Learning and Inspiring Day for me.
