# Day 1:_Induction Programme_
   When I visited **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** first time to attend **Induction Program**, I felt so delighted and lucky one. Firstly, I visit **Gurudwara Sahib** of the College and spent **3hours**
 there and it was really a peaceful time of the day. There I learnt many moral values and way to live life in College which was taught by **Granthi** of the Gurudwara. Then I have some refreshments which was arranged by the College Authority. I enjoy the refreshment very much.
